*ALGORITHUMS USED*
1. data processing using numpy and pandas
2. postemming using nltk library
3. stopwords removal  using nltk library
4. getting count of words using countvectorizer
5. transformation of vector using tfidf transformer to get the weight of the words
6. using pickle to save the model and load the model
7. use django for wev development 
8. extract.py contains all the function to extract the keywords from the given document

**STEPS TO RUN THE CODE** 
1. install all the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt
2. open terminal "cd dev"
3. run command "python manage.py runserver" to run django server
